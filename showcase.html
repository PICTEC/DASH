    <p>
        Speech technologies related both to voice communication and automated
        speech processing are not robust to environment noise.
        Frontend speech technologies are key to high quality and performance.
       	In this demonstrator, we showcase various mono- and multi-channel speech
        enhancement algorithms.

        There are three approaches used in this demonstrator. Soft masking is
        used to determine which time-frequency bins correspond to speech
        and which to noise, and use this to filter out the undesired noise.
        Deep autoencoders are neural networks trained to reconstruct original signal
        from contaminated source. Beamforming techniques use information about
        shift in time of arrival to each microphone to spatially filter out
        signal coming from different directions. Our deep beamformer uses LSTMs
        to obtain spatial parameters of the speech signal.

		How to use
	</h4>
	<p>
		You may choose any of the models presented and listen to both input and output signals in the headphones. The application may take some time to load to ensure that chosen model runs without interruption.

        There are three general approaches used in this demonstrator. Masking is used to determine which
        time-frequency bins correspond to desired signal and which to noise and use this information to block
        undesired signal. Autoencoders are neural networks trained to reconstruct original signal from
        contaminated source. Beamforming techniques use information about shift in time of arrival to
        each microphone to determine direction of the source and filter out signal coming from different
        directions.
