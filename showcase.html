        Speech technologies related both to telecommunication and processing are not robust to external environment.
        Due to that, frontend speech technologies are key to effective usage of this communication channel.
       	In this demonstrator we showcase various mono- and multi-channel speech enhancement algorithms.

        There are three general approaches used in this demonstrator. Masking is used to determine which
        time-frequency bins correspond to desired signal and which to noise and use this information to block
        undesired signal. Autoencoders are neural networks trained to reconstruct original signal from
        contaminated source. Beamforming techniques use information about shift in time of arrival to
        each microphone to determine direction of the source and filter out signal coming from different
        directions.
