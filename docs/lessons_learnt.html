      The DASH project was our clash with delivering real-time, production ready solution.
      Training models running in RT and optimizing the code for RT has shown some challenges
      that were not obvious at the first sight in offline development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our initial vision was to deliver beamforming model and apply a postfilter that would
      recognize speech and speech only. While we produced both parts of the pipeline, they
      could not be run together without experiencing delays. Our initial goal was to process
      an audio frame in 8ms, which was not unreasonable given the sheer compute amount provided
      by NVidia Xavier. Making any reasonable model run in 8ms was very hard, therefore had to settle
      to 16 millisecond window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The core of the problem lied in the multiprocessing nature of the system. While we had
      an audio pipeline for processing of the frames, audio capture was best done in parallel,
      which in turn with infamous GIL, didn't really matter - they "stole" the time from the main
      thread whenever audio frame was available. Yielding from threads reduced the load by avoiding
      busy loops but still took a reasonable amount of time. We didn't manage to move the audio
      to separate process as we have done with GUI thread, but this could've been the solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, when we reduced all interference to our software, we focused on optimization of 
      the main loop. There were two different parts: the ANN runtime and the rest of the models.
    </p>
    <p>
      We benchmarked the ANNs and removed some code introduced by Keras' <code>predict()</code>
      by accessing the tensorgraph directly. The speed up was negligible, so I investigated on the
      speed of Xavier's GPU, which was underwhelming. I've used <i>cupy</i> for some mock
      multiplications, which are the most important operations in ANN computation. I've tested both
      float32 and float16 (which allegedly speeds up Xavier even more), but there results here are
      for float32 only:

      What has stricken me was the lack of differences between several first shapes and
      drastic effect of thresholding (e.g. 512 vs 514 units in multiplication) on the total runtime.
      The Xavier unit has 512 cores that operate in parallel, so that threshold seemed natural. But
      some differences between computation times were surprising. It seemed that reshaping the
      input from batches to time dimension reduced the runtime drastically without changing the
      meaning of the operation. It was <i>more</i> optimal to perform double transposition and
      multiplication on transposed arrays than the straightforward operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This all could've been the gimmicks of the cupy implementation. Our observations however
      were confirmed in practice, as we were able to run LSTM on eight concurrent channels
      with no noticeable slowdown compared to a single channel. This helped us a lot and pointed
      out how inefficient our code was with the compute that was available.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tegra units are made for image processing, which is significatly different than 
      dense computations we performed in our networks. This could explain the significant loss
      of performance as most image processing consists of 4D convolution operation and the hardware
      was optimized for this operation. Nevertheless we wanted to use the GPU for other operations
      that could be easily parallelized. The MVDR after all is calculated at each frequency separately.
    </p>
    <p>
      MVDR and other parts that were required to use it had two bottleneck operations. First
      was inversion of the covariance matrices. The second - finding the eigenvector.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our first implementation using numpy used for loop and np.linalg.inv() and was obviously inefficient.
      Built-in inv() can be run in parallel for each matrix designated by last two indices and
      this solution solved the problem slightly above 7ms of wall time. This was insufficient, but
      we couldn't shave it off. Natural thought was to run it on GPU. CuPy implementation however
      performed the inversion 
    </p>
    <p>
      Similar problems were encountered in eigenvector decomposition. Our final solution was
      to use an iterative method that moved the eigenvector towards the desired direction with
      each iteration. Cupy implementation was of no help either.
    </p>
    <p>
      Single channel instances of DASH demo were able to run more smoothly on my i5 laptop than
      on the Xavier. This has shown how underutilized the GPU was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Xavier is an excellent tool capable of running multiple data streams in parallel. Our project
      wasn't the most optimized, but the results are interesting - we probably would be able to 
      process more recordings at once (we didn't hit the limit on channels), but not necessarily faster.
      Our autoencoders could reliably run under 6ms out of required 16ms and there were no problem
      with running multiple channels at once in our masking network. Xavier offers interesting scaling
      possibilities, but those are probably mostly horizontal as far as real-time is concerned. Operations
      that are not typically expressed as multiplication of large matrices were not optimal, especially when
      the task consisted of multitude of very small matrices (as in the inversion). If you are building
      real-time solution on Xavier, stick to neural networks and avoid unconventional operations. LSTM
      is also probably the bad solution unless you really need it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This conclusion could obviously be incomplete, as there are dedicated units for other operations,
      as well as dedicated sound processing unit. We didn't touch this submodule (and could not find
      any documentation either), therefore it is possible that using some clever low-level programming
      and crafting the implementations of the algorithms to be run in speech enhancement methods
      the limitation we experienced can be omitted.
